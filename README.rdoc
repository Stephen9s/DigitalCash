Digital cash concept in Ruby. Not ideal, but written for Graduate Cryptography class. The concept involves sending payments that cannot be traced. All transactions are anonymous.

This version is not anonymous, but a proof-of-concept that uses a database to keep track of who currently owns the cash. A user may own the coin now, and that coin can be passed along, but evidence of who created that coin is not apparent.
